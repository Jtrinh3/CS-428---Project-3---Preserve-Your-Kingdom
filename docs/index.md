# Project 3 Preserve Your Kingdom
The idea of this project is to create a game where the user defend their castle from enemies by being able to pick them up and throw them as well as use tools and weaponry to help. This game was originally inspired by the flash game *Defend Your Kingdom* which is available to play on [Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com/games/zack6723/random-flash-game).

## What can you do in this game?
As of beta, the game has 3 stages that takes place immediately one after another. The user can throw tanks to destroy them as well as the flying variant, grab missiles to bust them, and yeet saucers back to their home planet.
